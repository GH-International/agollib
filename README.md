Python library for monitoring an ArcGIS Online subscription using ArcGIS REST API

The purpose of this project is to provide some minimal tools for monitoring an organization's 
Esri ArcGIS Online subscription.

Note carefully: the user needs administrative access to their ArcGIS Online account to use!

The getSiteUsers.py and getSiteItems.py scipts demonstrate how to dump selected information 
into CSV files that can be opened and analyzed in Excel.
